Note: for online testing copy the content of the file that exist in the folder named (dartpad)
 and paste the content on https://dartpad.dev/ panel 
 keep in mind testing does not support all the features in the project mainly localstrorage
 (storage will not be working if testing online)

- the app uses the CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), and save students to localstorage
and retrives them on startup if they exist in localstorage

create: via + button to create new student
read: available students will be read and displayed on homepage screen
update: clicking on the existing students on hompeage will take you to edit student page to update
delete: clicking on delete Icon delete the studen
